## Visit the [website](https://chocobumps.github.io/pokemon-search-reactJS/) here.

### This simple project is a Pokemon search application developed using React.js and Tailwind CSS. This allows users to search for a Pokemon and retrieve data from Pokemon API. It utilizes various features and libraries in React like "HashRouter" for routing, "useQuery" for caching, and "QueryClientProvider" for managing the state of API calls. (Currently in development).

## Key Features
- Users can search a Pokemon by name and retrieve data such as sprites and types.
- Live search filtering funtionality as the user types in the search bar.
- Utilizes caching to store previously fetched Pokemon to minimize API calls and improving response time.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing experience across diifferent screen sizes.

## Highlights
- Utilized the useQuery hook from the react-query library to fetch data from the Pokemon API asynchronously.
- Implemented client-side routing using HashRouter from React Router to navigate between different pages of the application.
- Employed basic caching techniques by queryClient from react-query to optimize API requests and improve performance.
- Designed the user interface using Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and responsive layout.
